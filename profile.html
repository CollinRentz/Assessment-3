   <paragraph> My Favorite Band:
    <br>
    I fell in-love with music when I was 12 years old. All because I found Imagine Dragons. It's 10+ years later and I love the band and their music even more than I did. Their music inspired me to explore myself artistically. I've since learned a lot about myself and my artistic ability.

My Wife:
<br>
I met my wife while serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Washington state. She was also serving a mission there. I love her an unbelievable amount. She supports me and helps me to be the best version of myself.

My Hobbies:
<br>
I love many artistic activities like acrylic painting, digital rendering, digital painting, and even writing music. I also enjoy winter athletics such as skiing and snowboarding. I enjoy camping and the outdoors in moderation. I also enjoy videogames. Judge me all you want but I still enjoy Fortnite, ecspecially since I started before it was popular. I think it gets a bad rep because of the cringe fanbase.
